===========================
Tutorial 9: Using XML Graph
===========================

The aim of this tutorial is to show how graphs, produced by the 
extension (`sav_charts 
<https://extensions.typo3.org/extension/sav_charts>`_), can be 
introduced in an extension generated by the SAV Library Kickstarter.

In this example, two graphs about the weather are displayed:

- One graph shows the number of sunny, cloudy and rainy days in a pie chart.
- One graph shows the evolution of the minimal and maximal temperatures in
  a line chart.
  
You can download this example from the TER (`sav_library_example9 
<https://extensions.typo3.org/extension/sav_library_example9>`_).
