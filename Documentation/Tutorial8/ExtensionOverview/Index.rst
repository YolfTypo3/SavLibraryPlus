Extension Overview
==================

Edit the extension `sav_library_example8 
<https://extensions.typo3.org/extension/sav_library_example8>`_ 
in the SAV Library Kickstarter to get an overview. It contains:

- Two forms (USER, ADMIN),

- Five views (USER_List, USER_Edit, ADMIN_List, ADMIN_Single,
  ADMIN_Edit),

- Two queries (USER_Query, ADMIN_Query).

The organization of the forms is quite similar to the previous
examples. Just click on them to analyze it. Let us focus on the
configurations associated with the existing table **fe_users** by
clicking on the link **fe_users**. As it can be seen, all fields have
type **Only shown in SAV Form**.

When the extension was created, by clicking on the link  **Import
fields from table as “Only shown in SAV form”** , all fields from
the table **fe_users** were imported, then unwanted fields were
removed.

The User Form (USER)
====================

In this example, it was chosen to design a very simple form consisting
in the display of the user image field. The image is associated with a
link to open the user form in the edit mode.


The Query USER_Query
====================

The query is used to filter the **fe_users** table with the
authenticated user. This is easily done by using the marker **###user###**
in the **WHERE clause** of the query.

The Views USER_List and USER_Edit
=================================

The template associated with these views is quite simple since the
only field to display is **image**.

And to make it possible to generate the link to open the input view,
only a few configuration attributes are required.

.. figure:: ../../Images/Tutorial8KickstarterFieldConfiguration.png 

- **func = makeItemLink;** generates the link for the current item.

- **edit = 1;** opens the edit view instead of the default view (**Single**
  view).

- **width = 50;** and **height = 50;** define the size of the image.

Because there is no **Single** view associated with the user form, the
default **Edit** view title bar must be changed, in particular the **save
and show** and the **show button** must be removed. The example comes a
directory **Resources/Private/Partials** which contains two directories
**TitleBars** and **Footers**. They respectively contain a folder
**EditView** which contain themselves a new **default.html** Fluid file.
We will see later how to call these new **Partials**.

Finally, to override the default css, the example comes with a css
file **sav_library_example8.css** in the **Resources/Public/Css**
directory which contains the following instructions :

::

   .sav_library_example8_user .savLibraryPlus .listView {width:62px;background-color:#ffffff;}
   .sav_library_example8_user .savLibraryPlus .listView .titleBar {display:none;}
   .sav_library_example8_user .savLibraryPlus .listView .items .item {border:none;background-color:#ffffff;}

Concerning the view USER_edit, each field with the tyep **Only shown in SAV Form** (ShowOnly fields)
has the property :ref:`updateShowOnlyField <savlibrarykickstarter:showOnly.updateShowOnlyField>` set to 1. 
By default in **ShowOnly** fields are not created 
nor can be updated. Setting this property to 1 overrides the default behavior. 

The Administration Form (ADMIN)
===============================

The administration form is used in the frontend to manage, give
rights, export frontend users. It is based on a conventional query, **List**,
**Single** and **Edit** views for which no specific configuration is
needed. Just click on the different views and tabs to see how fields
are grouped.
