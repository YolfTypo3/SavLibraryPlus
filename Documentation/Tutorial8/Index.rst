=====================================
Tutorial 8: Fe Users Admin and Export
=====================================

The aim of this tutorial is to show how an extension can be easily
built from an existing table. It will also be explained how to export
data in CSV from the extension.

The example deals with the **fe_users** table from which we want to build
two forms:

- The first one (USER) is for the authenticated user who wants to manage
  his/her personal data.

- The second one (ADMIN) is for a frontend Admin user who may manage all users
  and export them.

You can download this example from the TER (`sav_library_example8 
<https://extensions.typo3.org/extension/sav_library_example8>`_).
