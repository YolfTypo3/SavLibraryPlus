===========
Single View
===========

In this view, we have to deal with two problems:

- Positioning correctly the fields,

- Executing a plugin from the `maps2 <https://extensions.typo3.org/extension/maps2>`_ extenstion.


Positioning the Fields
======================

The positioning of the fields is very simple in the **List** view
because you can define the template. For the **Single** and **Edit**
views, the positioning can be obtained using the 
:ref:`wrapItem  <savlibrarykickstarter:general.wrapItem>` property.
This property has the same syntax and the same behaviour as the **wrap**
property in TypoScript.

To perform the requested positioning, we will use <div> tags organized
as follows:

The wrapping is done field by field. For example, the first field is
**image**. It defines the beginning of the container <div> and the image
<div> when the following property is used:

::

   wrapItem = <div class="container"><div class="image"> | </div>;

- Analyze the :ref:`wrapItem  <savlibrarykickstarter:general.wrapItem>`  
  for all the fields, then open the file
  **sav_library_example10.css** in the
  **Resources/Public/Css** directory to analyze the configuration. As
  it can be seen, the labels associated with the field are not displayed
  thanks to the {display:none;} CSS configuration. Let us note that the
  same result could have been obtained using the 
  :ref:`cutLabel  <savlibrarykickstarter:general.cutLabel>` property in
  the Kickstarter (see for example the **image** and **map** fields).


Executing the Plugin
====================

Executing a plugin in the extension can simply be done by means of the
:ref:`tsObject <savlibrarykickstarter:general.tsObject>` and
:ref:`tsProperties  <savlibrarykickstarter:general.tsProperties>` properties. 
The :ref:`tsObject <savlibrarykickstarter:general.tsObject>` is a content
object in TypoScript, that is TEXT, FILE, CONTENT, ... Below is the configuration
of the field **map**.

::

   tsObject = USER;

The **USER** is used to execute the action **show** of the plugin **Maps2**.
The extension **settings** are iported and modified. Let us note the use of
the marker **###poi_uid###** which provides the uid of the point of interest for
the map.

::

   tsProperties =
      userFunc = TYPO3\CMS\Extbase\Core\Bootstrap->run
      extensionName = Maps2
      pluginName = Maps2
      vendorName = JWeiland
      action = show

      switchableControllerActions {
         PoiCollection { 
            1 = show
         }
      }

      settings < plugin.tx_maps2.settings
      settings {
         zoom = 18
         poiCollection = ###poi_uid###
         category =
         mapWidth = 100%
         mapHeight = 300
      }
   }  
   ;

::

      showIf = 0 < ###poi_uid###;

The :ref:`showIf <savlibrarykickstarter:general.showIf>` property checks 
if the marker **###poi_uid###** is positive. If true the map is displayed,
otherwise it is cut as shown below.

.. figure:: ../../Images/Tutorial10SingleViewWithoutAddress.png

Let us now explain how the marker **###poi_uid###** is set. Let us 
have a look to the configuration of the field **poi_uid** whose type
is **Show Only**.

The first configuration is to always cut the field, i.e. it will not 
be displayed because it is is just a working field.

::

   cutIf = true;

The second configuration gets the **uid** by means of a **CONTENT** object.
The marker **###uidMainTable###** is always available. It is replaced by the
uid of the current field in the main table.  

::   

   tsObject = CONTENT;
   tsProperties =
      table = tx_maps2_domain_model_poicollection
      select {
         join = tx_savlibraryexample10_poi_mm ON tx_maps2_domain_model_poicollection.uid = tx_savlibraryexample10_poi_mm.uid_foreign
         selectFields = tx_maps2_domain_model_poicollection.uid
         where = uid_local = ###uidMainTable###
      }
   renderObj = TEXT
   renderObj.field = uid
   ; 

The third configuration sets the field value in the marker **poi_uid**, i.e.
the marker **###poi_uid###** is now available. 

::

   renderFieldInMarker = poi_uid;
