How to Display a Title in the Upper Icon Bar of the View?
=========================================================

A title can be associated with each view. It is defined in the **Title
bar** section of the views. Text, language markers or field markers can
be used.

For example, if you use **$$$formTitle$$$** in the **Title bar** field,
this language marker will be replaced by its definition in the
**locallang.xlf** file. In this example, **formTitle** is defined as **CD
Collection** for the default language and **Liste de CD** for the French
language. Therefore, the output becomes:

.. figure:: ../../Images/Tutorial2ListViewWithTitleBar.png

Now, if you use **###artist### - ###album_title###** in the **Title bar**
section of the **Single** and **Edit** views, the markers **###artist###**
and **###album_title###** will be replaced by the respective values of
the field **artist** and **album_title** for the current record. If these
markers are used in the **Title bar** section of the **List** view, they
will be replaced by the label associated with the fields. Thus, the
output is the following for the **Single** view:

How to Display the Labels Associated With Each Field in the Title Bar?
======================================================================

As explain above, field markers used in **List** view are replaced by
the label associated with the fields. Therefore, if the **Title bar**
section is the following:

::

   <ul>
      <li class="artist">###artist###</li>
      <li class="title">###album_title###</li>
      <li class="date">###date_of_purchase###</li>
      <li class="category">###category###</li>
      <li class="image">###coverimage###</li>
   </ul>

The title bar becomes:

How to Change the Order of the Item List by Clicking on the Label in the Title Bar?
===================================================================================

For example, assume that we want to change the displayed order by
clicking on **Artist** (or **Artiste** if you use the french language).

- Add the following configuration parameter in the **artist** field of the
  **All** view.

::

   OrderLinkInTitle = 1;

- Add the following configuration in the **WHERE Tags** section of your
  query. Click on the **plus** icon to add an entry.

In this configuration, use **filedname+** or **fieldname-** and associate
the order clause you want. In general **+** can be used for the
ascending order and **-** for the descending order.

By default, the displayed link will behave as a toogle between the
ascending and the descending sort. However you can control the display
using the property 
:ref:`orderLinkInTitleSetup <savlibrarykickstarter:general.orderLinkInTitleSetup>` 
which introduces links
associated with icons. For example, using **orderLinkInTitleSetup =
:value:ascdesc;** or **orderLinkInTitleSetup = asc:value:desc;** will
respectively provide the following outputs:

.. figure:: ../../Images/Tutorial2OrderLink1.png  
.. figure:: ../../Images/Tutorial2OrderLink2.png 

Of course, you may keep the toggle link by writing
respectively **orderLinkInTitleSetup = :link:ascdesc;** or
**orderLinkInTitleSetup = asc:link:desc;**.

The icon color will change depending on the sort order as shown below.
In the following caption, the descending order is displayed.

How to Reorganize the Fields with Folders?
==========================================

Folders may be introduced in the **Single** and **Edit** views to provide
a better organization of the information. Click on the **plus** icon to
add a folder.

.. figure:: ../../Images/Tutorial2KickstarterSingleViewWithFolder.png  

In this example, two folders are defined. If the labels **General** and
**Comments** are defined in the **locallang.xlf** file, they will be
replaced by their definition in the selected language, otherwise they
are used as it. Then, set a folder to each selected field of the **CD
Collection** table for the **Single** view as shown below, save and
generate the extension:

.. figure:: ../../Images/Tutorial2KickstarterFieldsOverviewWithFolders.png   

If you set all the fields to the folder **General** except the field
**description** which is set to **Comments**, the following views are
obtained in the frontend where the folder **General** and **Comments** 
have a French translation in **locallang.xlf**.
